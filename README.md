# Test Automation Framework

This project is a part of my learning journey in Selenium test automation. It serves as a practice ground to apply and enhance my skills in building a robust test automation framework.

## Goals

- Develop foundational knowledge of Selenium and automation testing.
- Continuously improve and expand the framework as I learn more advanced techniques and tools.
- Implement best practices for maintainability and scalability.

## Features (Current and Planned)

- **Selenium Integration**: Automating browser interactions and validating web application functionality.
- **TestNG Integration**: Writing and organizing test cases with assertions.
- **Modular Design**: Structuring the framework for easy scalability and reusability.
- **Maven Support**: Managing dependencies and building the project efficiently.

## Roadmap

1. Add support for cross-browser testing.
2. Integrate reporting tools for better test results visualization.
3. Implement data-driven testing using external data sources.
4. Introduce CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.
5. Explore integration with other tools like Cucumber for BDD.
